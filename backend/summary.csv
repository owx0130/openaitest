"The conversation shifts to the submarine optical fibre cable market, which is projected to increase substantially due to the demand for cloud services, data centres, offshore renewable energy projects, and global trade. However, the market is hindered by high installation and maintenance costs, natural disasters, and legal/political issues. Market players are investing in R&D and strategic partnerships to capitalize on growth. The conversation then moves to the competition between crypto and AI for tech innovators and venture capitalists, with AI traditionally centralized and crypto decentralized. AI is used to build decentralized controls, while crypto uses AI to build complex structures. Choosing the right mix of centralization and decentralization is a key social issue. The AI then brings up the Neptun Deep Black Sea gas project in Romania, which is expected to make Romania a net exporter of gas by 2027 and generate 20 billion euros in state revenue. The AI then discusses the recent surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories due to increased exports and decreased imports, but notes that higher interest rates and minor product builds have caused prices to fall and refinery utilization rates to decrease. The conversation then shifts to Israel's natural gas reserves, which have grown 40% in the past decade due to increased drilling and exploration, with five-fold growth in offshore production. The region has seen rapid expansion of natural gas production. The AI notes that U.S. crude oil inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, have risen to a two-year high due to outages at Midwestern refineries and higher flows from Canada, but predicts that overseas demand and refinery restarts should reverse the build."
