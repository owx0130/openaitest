Reddit - Dive into anything;;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/14vocgo/question_about_kmeans_clustering_using_sklearn/;;sklearn, kmeans, PCA;;Yes;;A user is seeking help on applying sklearn kmeans to a 3D dataset and asks if it is possible to do a 3D k-means cluster. They also question the use of PCA and propose an alternative approach using a model and training it on a subsection of the dataset. The author discusses creating and training a model on a smaller dataset, then using it to predict clusters in a larger dataset. They are seeking help and tips on this process.
