Top 10 ReadSoft Alternatives;;https://research.aimultiple.com/readsoft-alternatives/;;ReadSoft, Hypatos, Rossum, Medius, Quadient;;Yes;;ReadSoft, a pioneer in intelligent accounts payable automation, faces competition from new solution providers claiming to offer higher levels of automation. Businesses looking to migrate from ReadSoft have many alternative solutions available. One such alternative is Hypatos, which offers deep learning technology for document automation and can help with efficiency issues in AP automation. Hypatos' AP automation helps businesses avoid paying for duplicate or fraudulent bills, with its Continual Learning feature making it easier to annotate and reuse data. Positive reviews of Hypatos can be found on G2 and Capterra. Another alternative is Rossum, an AI company that offers a platform for extracting data from invoices and receipts. While it can reduce manual data entry and integrate with various ERP and accounting systems, there are some issues with extracting data from different types of documents. Medius, a leading provider of cloud-based spend management solutions, also offers an accounts payable automation solution. Users are happy with its features, although there are some issues with data extraction and language recognition. Quadient Accounts Payable Automation by Beanworks is another platform that automates and streamlines accounts payable processes. Users agree that it can prevent duplicate payments and offers integration with other accounting and financial management software. However, it may not be suitable for handling large numbers of invoices, and making changes in approval channels can be time-consuming. Hyland's OnBase software is another alternative that automates accounts payable processes, improving efficiency and reducing mistakes. It offers services such as automatic notification and invoice data capture. A case study on Canal Barge showed improved efficiency in invoice tracking, visibility, and approval, while a case study on a North American Mining Company demonstrated increased capacity and reduced costs in handling higher volumes of invoices. However, some users have criticized the lack of in-use and customer support, as well as the complexity of the software. Overall, these alternatives provide various options for businesses seeking alternatives to ReadSoft.
LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment - The paper that will shake up AI [Breakdowns];;https://artificialintelligencemadesimple.substack.com/p/lima-less-is-more-for-alignment-the;;Devansh, Microsoft Research, GPT-3.5, LIMA, Alpaca 65B;;Yes;;Devansh offers a series called Breakdowns where he analyzes complicated literature on Machine Learning to provide valuable insights. He aims to help readers understand Cutting Edge AI Research and Deep Learning. A new large language model for code called phi-1 has been introduced by Microsoft Research. Despite its smaller size, phi-1 achieves high accuracy and displays surprising emergent properties. GPT-3.5 achieves high accuracy on HumanEval and MBPP despite its small scale. Selecting a few samples can significantly improve the performance of large baseline models without increasing the cost. The LIMA model demonstrates strong performance in learning specific response formats from limited examples in the training data. It also generalizes well to unseen tasks. The text discusses the fragility of an approach due to adversarial inputs and introduces the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis, which suggests that large language models primarily learn during pretraining rather than during alignment. The text discusses the concept of tuning pretrained language models to match specific needs. It suggests that a small set of carefully selected samples can be sufficient for tuning the models. The text discusses the importance of setting up quality checks and evaluating the results of experiments involving LLMs. The text discusses the agreement scores among human annotators for a task involving annotation examples. LIMA performs well in test prompts, with 50% of answers considered excellent and only 12% designated as fail. Summary: The text discusses the performance of different AI models, such as Alpaca 65B, DaVinci003, Bard, Claude, and GPT-4, compared to LIMA. While some models generally perform better than LIMA, there are instances where LIMA produces better responses. The authors also mention that larger models may have higher returns but can burden the system. The authors found that LIMA struggles with structurally complex text and cannot consistently respond to questions that require summarizing or writing articles with specific elements. However, additional training and formatted outputs can improve LIMA's performance. The text discusses the improvement of LIMA responses through structure-oriented training examples and the evaluation of the results through ablation studies. Summary: The authors conducted a study to understand the impact of data diversity, quality, and quantity on an AI system's alignment. They found that increasing input diversity and output quality had positive effects on alignment, while increasing quantity alone did not. This supports the idea that scaling up models/training may not always be beneficial. The study compared the effects of prompt diversity using different datasets. Doubling the training set does not improve response quality, suggesting that the scaling laws of alignment are not solely dependent on quantity but also on prompt diversity and maintaining high quality responses. The LIMA approach allows for efficient tuning of LLMs for specific needs, but it is not as robust as product-grade models. It is vulnerable to weak responses and adversarial prompts, posing a security risk. Using a few high-quality samples to teach AI models can be efficient, but it can also pose security risks. Adversarial prompts that match the general outline well can exploit the model's vulnerabilities. The text suggests using a retrieval-based architecture for information retrieval and synthesis instead of fine-tuning GPT on data. The LIMA approach, despite its fragility, is game-changing for AI and can be used with Open Source LLMs to create convincing proof of concepts and demos. This will help democratize ML and improve the accessibility of AI and ML Entrepreneurship.

ChatGPT: A Bullshit Tool For Bullshit Jobs;;https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/chatgpt-a-bullshit-tool-for-bullshit;;ChatGPT, author, David Graeber, workers, technology;;Yes;;ChatGPT, a language model, is considered a "bullshit generator" as it doesn't prioritize truth in its output. However, the author sees this as a positive attribute, making it versatile and useful in various situations. The text argues against using chatbots to replace human communication in sensitive and real-life situations, but acknowledges that automating corporate writing tasks can be beneficial. The author reflects on their own experience and realizes that ChatGPT is a valuable tool for those trying to escape the emptiness of corporate work. It also discusses anthropologist David Graeber's concept of "bullshit jobs" and how technology has created pointless jobs, causing moral and spiritual damage. The text questions the value of certain types of work and suggests shorter working hours. ChatGPT is widely adopted by workers seeking to eliminate meaningless tasks and fill their lives with something more meaningful. The text acknowledges criticisms of ChatGPT, such as data gathering without permission or compensation and lack of transparency, but appreciates its use in avoiding corporate nonsense. It also discusses the use of ChatGPT for generating jargon-filled reports and questions the percentage of users who employ it for such purposes.
ReadSoft faces competition from alternative solutions like Hypatos, Rossum, Medius, Quadient, and Hyland's OnBase. These alternatives offer various features and benefits but also have some limitations. The text discusses the performance of different AI models, the importance of data diversity and quality, and the vulnerabilities of the LIMA approach. It also explores the versatility of ChatGPT as a tool for automating corporate writing tasks and escaping meaningless work. While acknowledging criticisms, the text recognizes the value of ChatGPT in avoiding corporate nonsense.
