Reddit - Dive into anything;;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/14vlzzv/determining_arima_model_parameters_for_daily_time/;;ARIMA, machine learning subreddit, ACF, PACF, Auto ARIMA;;Yes;;The conversation is about parameter values for time series forecasting using ARIMA on a machine learning subreddit. The person mentions their current project on time series forecasting using the ARIMA model. They have questions about determining the appropriate values for the parameters p, d, and q. Specifically, they want to know the recommended range for these values given that they are working with daily forecasting. They also ask for advice on whether to rely on ACF or PACF graphs or to use the Auto ARIMA approach for identifying the values of p, d, and q.
