On the Stepwise Nature of  Self-Supervised Learning â€“ The Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Blog;;http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2023/07/10/stepwise-ssl/;;self-supervised learning, SSL, deep learning models, Barlow Twins, SimCLR, VICReg;;Yes;;The conversation discusses self-supervised learning (SSL) and its role in training deep learning models to extract useful representations from unlabeled data. A recent paper presents a mathematical model that explains the training process of large-scale self-supervised learning methods, opening new possibilities for improvement and understanding of deep learning systems. The text focuses on joint-embedding SSL methods and describes a linear model of SSL and its stepwise learning process. The model learns top eigendirections one at a time in discrete learning steps. Figure 2 illustrates this learning process, showing both the growth of a new direction in the represented function and the resulting drop in the loss at each learning step. The figure also demonstrates the concept of spectral bias in learning systems, where many systems preferentially learn eigendirections with higher eigenvalues. Approximately linear dynamics preferentially learn eigendirections with higher eigenvalues, which has been well-studied in the case of standard supervised learning. This finding extends to semi-supervised learning and wide neural networks, suggesting that insights from linear models can apply to realistic cases. The training and generalization of even nonlinear neural networks are discussed, suggesting that some insights from linear models might transfer to realistic cases. The presence of stepwise learning in realistic settings can be observed by tracking the eigenvalues of the embedding covariance matrix over time. The experiments discussed in the paper are shown in Figure 3, which shows stepwise learning in Barlow Twins, SimCLR, and VICReg. These SSL methods achieve similar performance on benchmark tasks, indicating shared behavior. The challenge is to identify the underlying shared behavior. Prior theoretical work has focused on analytical similarities in their loss functions, but experiments suggest that SSL methods learn embeddings one dimension at a time, iteratively adding new dimensions in order of salience. Comparisons between real embeddings and theoretical predictions show agreement within and across methods. Various joint-embedding SSL methods achieve similar performance, and the challenge is to identify the shared behavior. Experiments suggest that SSL methods learn embeddings one dimension at a time, adding new dimensions iteratively. Comparisons between real embeddings and theoretical predictions show agreement within and across methods. The potential practical applications of this theoretical understanding include aiding the practice of SSL and improving representation learning. SSL training is slow due to the long time constants of later eigenmodes. Selectively focusing the gradient on small embedding eigendirections could speed up training. The paper explores these possibilities. Questions about the usefulness and semantic content of eigenmodes are raised, and the paper delves into these questions as well. The possibility of assigning semantic content to eigenmodes in deep learning and the implications it may have for future studies in the field are discussed.
