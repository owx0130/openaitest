My "box" is organised as follows: [value, x, y] where x and y are spatial coordinates. I would like to train the model to show how the value of each pixel varies with its location and cluster accordingly. So, my questions are the following:      is it not possible to do a 3D k-means cluster? I have tried to use PCA, but this results in no clusters when I try to plot the results. Maybe I'm doing this is in the wrong way, or maybe this is the wrong approach. Idk.      Would the following way be a good way to solve this without doing PCA, or would this give me nonsensical results?> model = KMeans( ... )> for i in range(ylim[0], ylim[1]):>     model.fit(smaller_dataset[: ,: ,i])> result = model.fit_predict(large_dataset)      My thought here is to first create the model, then train it on a subsection of the large dataset and then use this to predict what clusters the values of the full dataset belong to.      I am totally new to ML so there might be a very obvious solution to this that I do not see.. So any help/tips would be welcome.

As part of this process, I need to determine the appropriate values for the parameters p,d and q.      I have couple of questions regarding this:      1.Given that we are working with daily forecasting,I suspect that the values of p,d and q may be larger. Could you please advise me on the recommended range for these values?      2.In terms of identifying the values of p,d and q, I am unsure whether to rely on ACF or PACF graphs or to use Auto ARIMA approach. Which method would you recommend as the better option?
