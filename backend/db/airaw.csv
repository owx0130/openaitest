As part of this process, I need to determine the appropriate values for the parameters p,d and q.      I have couple of questions regarding this:      1.Given that we are working with daily forecasting,I suspect that the values of p,d and q may be larger. Could you please advise me on the recommended range for these values?      2.In terms of identifying the values of p,d and q, I am unsure whether to rely on ACF or PACF graphs or to use Auto ARIMA approach. Which method would you recommend as the better option?

So while learning I've created a JS package which allows you to create and learn about neural networks.      The package is not perfect and there might be bugs in it, so feel free to raise an issue or create a PR.      The package is implemented from scratch without using any library so that anyone who goes through the code can understand every detail of it.      You guys can also DM me if you have any queries.      GitHub Link      NPM Package Link      Thanks
