It also discusses the philosophical question raised by the twisted column on the old town hall and mentions the famous Czech writer Milan Kundera, who was born in Brno. Kundera's artistic upbringing, early interest in music and film, and emergence as a renowned writer with works like "The Joke" are highlighted. However, it also mentions the political challenges faced by Kundera and the censorship of his books. Kundera gained fame with his novel "The Joke" but faced backlash for his criticism of the Czech regime. He was later exiled to France and became a French citizen. Despite some people's perception of Kundera as a beloved figure in Czech literature, the Czech people generally prefer other authors such as Hrabal and Klima. Kundera's works are more popular outside of Czech Republic, and he has been awarded the Czech National Literature Prize. However, he has refused to accept the award and has distanced himself from his homeland. Kundera's life as an exile in Paris is also mentioned, where he has become a French citizen and focuses on his writing. His preference for privacy and belief in the power of novels to explore human nature and challenge historical forgetfulness are discussed. Kundera's writings explore the struggle between memory and forgetting and the battle against banality. Despite being unable to publish in his native language, Kundera's works had a significant impact in China when they were translated. His novels resonated with Chinese readers and shifted the focus from collective narratives to individual experiences. He challenged the notion that writers lose their soul when they are exiled from their homeland and emphasized the importance of existence and human potential. Kundera's works sparked a wave of interest in Eastern European literature and thinking in China.
