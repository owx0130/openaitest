The film, released in Vietnam on July 21, was banned due to an image showing a cartoon map resembling the controversial "nine-dash line" in the South China Sea. Warner Bros claims that the map was a whimsical and child-like drawing. Vietnam has also halted showings of the DreamWorks film "Abominable" and criticized Netflix offerings for misrepresenting its borders. The South Korean group BlackPink's concert in Hanoi may face a boycott or ban after an image of the disputed "nine-dash line" was posted on their promoter's website. The promoter has apologized and removed the image, but the incident is being investigated by Vietnamese cultural authorities.
