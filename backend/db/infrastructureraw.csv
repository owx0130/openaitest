It aims to start commercial operation of the new facilities in the fourth quarter of 2024.In addition to the new processing unit, Pinnacle said it intends to expand gathering and compression facilities throughout Midland, Martin, and Glasscock counties to accommodate expected and future volumes. It did not provide details on specific growth plans beyond the processing addition.The company’s infrastructure is anchored by long-term acreage dedications with active Permian operators and designed for efficient expansions to support high-intensity pad development and increasing gas/oil ratio throughout the basin.Pinnacle founder and CEO J. Greg Sargent said the Dos Picos processing expansion “ensures we can provide the best service to our current and future customers, maximize their recoveries, and help limit flaring across the basin.The Train II facility will complement Pinnacle’s existing processing facilities and high-pressure, large diameter gathering and compression infrastructure that commenced operations during the first quarter of 2021.The company also provides multiple bi-directional and high-pressure third-party interconnects with peer companies within the region to maximize flow assurances for producers and third-party midstream customers, the company said.Pinnacle Midstream II is backed by Energy Spectrum Capital, a Dallas-based infrastructure firm that makes direct investments in companies that acquire, develop, and operate energy assets in North America.
BP Settles US Natural Gas Market Manipulation Case for $10.8 Million | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/bp-settles-us-natural-gas-market-manipulation-case-for-108-million;;;;;;(Reuters) — Oil major BP has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10.75 million to cover allegations company traders manipulated natural gas markets in 2008, which is less than BP has already paid in the case, U.S. energy regulators said in a filing.The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) alleged that BP violated the Natural Gas Act by manipulating the next-day gas market at Houston Ship Channel from mid-September through Nov. 30, 2008.BP paid a civil penalty of $24,356,686 in December 2020 and disgorgement of unjust profits of $250,295 in January 2021 in the case. But the company paid those penalties under protest and appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which remanded the matter back to FERC to reassess the civil penalty.The settlement announced in the filing late on Friday resolves the case.FERC said under the settlement BP will not seek return of the $250,295 of disgorgement it has paid.The regulator also said its Office of Enforcement "will not object should BP choose to seek to reclaim the excess payment of $13,606,686 through a suit" in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims or any other forum of competent jurisdiction.Officials at BP were not immediately available for comment.The case related to actions by BP traders to take advantage of market dislocations around the time Hurricane Ike smashed into the Houston area in September 2008.FERC's Office of Enforcement alleged BP traders made uneconomic physical gas sales to suppress the Houston Ship Channel Gas Daily index and boost the value of BP's financial position.
