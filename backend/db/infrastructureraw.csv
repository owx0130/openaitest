ADNOC Invests $1.34 Billion in 186-Mile Expansion of UAE Gas Pipeline Network | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/adnoc-invests-134-billion-in-186-mile-expansion-of-uae-gas-pipeline-network;;;;;;(P&GJ) — Petrofac Emirates LLC and a Consortium made up of National Petroleum Construction Co. PJSC and C.A.T International Ltd. have been awarded substantial contracts for a combined $1.34 billion by ADNOC Gas Plc, Saudi Gulf Projects reported.According to the Sales Gas Pipeline Network Enhancement (ESTIDAMA) initiative, these contracts have been given in order to assist the growth of ADNOC Gas' natural gas pipeline network.ADNOC Gas is set to revolutionize natural gas distribution in the Northern Emirates of the United Arab Emirates with an ambitious expansion plan, increasing its pipeline network by approximately 300 km (186 miles) from over 3,200 km (1,988 miles) to over 3,500 km (2,174 miles).ADNOC Gas' sustained growth will be fueled by the strategically expanded pipeline network, further solidifying its position as the UAE's top provider of sustainable gas. This move fits with the company's overall plan to increase its market share and draw in a larger customer base in order to offer the area gas that is both dependable and ecologically beneficial.According to Saudi Gulf Projects, Ahmed Mohamed Alebri, CEO of ADNOC Gas, highlighted that the strategic network expansion aims to bring the benefits of lower-cost, sustainable, and cleaner gas to various locations in the UAE.He said that by enhancing industrial access to natural gas, which is a cost-competitive and environmentally friendly fuel, the expanded pipeline will foster further growth for ADNOC Gas and its shareholders. This initiative aligns with their commitment to achieving gas self-sufficiency for the UAE.More than 70% of the contract value will be reinvested in the UAE economy thanks to ADNOC's strong In-Country Value (ICV) initiative, which was created to help local industry and strengthen the UAE's local value chain.The first part of the ESTIDAMA initiative, which comprises several phases, entailed modifying current pipelines and was successfully finished in 2023. Construction of additional pipelines and a gas compression facility in Habshan are part of the second and third stages, which are now under way.These projects will provide crucial infrastructure for supplying feed gas to important clients across the Emirates.The UAE's entire gas value chain is connected by ADNOC's integrated masterplan, providing a cost-effective and sustainable natural gas supply to fulfill domestic and global demand. The strategy calls for the development of unexplored resources as well as increased gas recovery from current assets.
Thailand's PTT Seeking 15-Year LNG Supply Deal with Qatar | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/thailands-ptt-seeking-15-year-lng-supply-deal-with-qatar;;;;;;(Reuters) — Thailand's largest energy company, state-controlled PTT, is in advanced talks with Qatar for a 15-year LNG supply deal, four trading sources told Reuters.The oil and gas conglomerate is negotiating a supply of 1 or 2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), according to different figures cited by the sources, in what would be the latest in a spate of deals by Asian buyers to lock in long term supplies.A fifth industry source said that both companies are in "serious negotiations” but added that a deal isn't expected before the end of summer.QatarEnergy and PTT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Qatar is the world's top LNG exporter and competition for LNG has ramped up since the beginning of the war last year in Ukraine, with Europe in particular needing vast amounts to help replace piped gas from Russia that previously made up almost 40% of the continent's imports.Asian companies, with an appetite for long-term sales and purchase agreements, have outpaced Europe in locking in supply from Qatar's two-phase expansion plan that will raise its liquefaction capacity to 126 million metric tons a year by 2027 from 77 million.The Gulf energy giant has been in negotiations with several other Asian buyers this year and has so far signed three LNG supply deals with Asian buyers, with more expected later this year.PTT has been seeking spot LNG cargoes this year, traders have said, along with other companies in emerging Asian markets, after prices of the super-chilled fuel eased from last year's record highs.PTT also signed a nine-year deal with Oman LNG at the start of the year, which will see it receive 800,000 tons of LNG per year beginning 2026.Thailand, a net oil and gas importer, needs to increase imports of LNG to offset a steep production fall at its gas fields. So far, the country has imported around 6 million tons of LNG this year versus 8.7 million tons in 2022, according to data firm Kpler.
