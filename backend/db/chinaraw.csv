Barbie: First reactions single out Ryan Gosling as ‘scene-stealer’ deserving of an Oscar | The Independent;;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/barbie-review-first-reactions-ryan-gosling-b2372369.html;;;;;;Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged inMovie had its star-studded premiere in LA on Sunday nightFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileThe pink carpet was rolled out last night (9 July) in Los Angeles for the world premiere of the Barbie movie, and the first reactions from critics have hit social media.Made by indie film prodigy Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, Barbie has received overwhelmingly positive early reviews after a screening attended by stars including Nicki Minaj and Dua Lipa.ScreenRant writer Joseph Deckelmeier called the film “funny, bombastic and very smart”, adding: “Greta Gerwig aims for the fences and hits a home run.”It is ComicBook.com writer Jamie Jirak’s “favourite film of the year”. She wrote: “Greta Gerwig somehow exceeded my expectations. She tackles the positives and negatives of Barbie so beautifully. Give Ryan Gosling an Oscar nomination, I’m dead serious!”Gosling was singled out for praise by numerous people, with “Pay or Wait” host Sharronda Williams calling the actor a “scene stealer delivering most of the laughs”.This Week Media editor Eze Baum said: “Barbie is a triumph. A pitch-perfect script backed by great performances – particularly from Ryan Gosling – turns what could be a simple studio comedy into a sharp commentary on our society that makes its nuance palatable for those that may not take it at face value. GG is 3/3.”Variety’s social media editor Katcy Stephan wrote: “Greta Gerwig delivers a nuanced commentary on what it means to be a woman in a whimsical, wonderful and laugh-out-loud funny romp. The entire cast shines, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in roles they were clearly born to play.”Collider’s Perri Nemiroff, meanwhile, enjoyed the costume and production design in the movie, but wasn’t quite as convinced on story. “I think the film serves Margot Robbie’s Barbie and her journey especially well,” she wrote, “but there are other characters experiencing important arcs that needed more screen time to really dig into and explore to the fullest.”Warner Bros was last week forced to defend a doodle of a map in the Barbie movie, after the film was banned in Vietnam.New subscribers only. £6.99/mo. after free trial.

Disputed map sparks Netflix removal of Chinese drama in Vietnam;;https://best-of-netflix.com/after-barbie-disputed-map-sparks-netflix-removal-of-chinese-drama-in-vietnam/;;;;;;Vietnam has ordered streaming giant Netflix and FPT Telecom, a local telecommunications company, to remove the Chinese TV drama Flight to You from their platforms. The move comes after the Vietnamese culture ministry’s cinema department deemed the show violating sovereignty laws for featuring a disputed map depicting islands in the South China Sea as non-Vietnamese territory.The department, which had previously requested FPT Telecom to blur the map image, found that the drama still contained inappropriate content and scenes featuring China’s controversial nine-dash line in nine of its episodes. The companies were given a 24-hour ultimatum to remove the show from Vietnam-serving platforms.This recent action marks the second time Hanoi has sought to restrict foreign entertainment within a week. Previously, Vietnam banned Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and Ruben Fleischer’s Uncharted, starring Tom Holland, due to similar concerns over the depiction of the disputed South China Sea map. The Vietnamese public has also witnessed instances of apologies and corrective actions from event organisers who inadvertently published the controversial map.Despite the removal from Netflix and FPT Telecom, the Chinese drama is still accessible on Huace Croton TV Vietnam’s YouTube account with Vietnamese narration. Both FPT Telecom and Netflix confirmed compliance with the government’s request.Vietnam has consistently taken a strong stance against any depiction of the nine-dash line, which is used by China to assert its claim over large portions of the South China Sea. The international community has widely rejected and condemned China’s claim. In previous instances, Vietnam has banned films and imposed fines on cinemas for screening movies that featured the disputed map.Jobs / Careers© 2023 Best Of Netflix
