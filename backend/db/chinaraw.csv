Map That Triggered Vietnam ‘Barbie’ Ban Was ‘Child-Like’ Drawing, Warner Bros Says – Eurasia Review;;https://www.eurasiareview.com/10072023-map-that-triggered-vietnam-barbie-ban-was-child-like-drawing-warner-bros-says/;;;;;;A Journal of Analysis and News Margot Robbie, star of the film “Barbie,” stands in front of the map that caused the Vietnamese government to ban the film. The part of the map that led to the ban is to the right of Robbie and has eight dashes off the shore of a large landmass labeled "Asia." Credit: Screenshot from Warner Bros Pictures “Barbie” videoBy RFA By Paul EckertWarner Bros on Friday said a supposed depiction of a map of the South China Sea that prompted Vietnam to ban the upcoming “Barbie” movie was a “child-like crayon drawing” that carried no political message.Vietnam announced early this week it had banned distribution of “Barbie” because its trailer includes a map that appeared to take China’s side in an emotive maritime territorial dispute.The decision to scrap the planned July 21 release of the Warner Bros feature film, starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as her boyfriend Ken, was made by the Central Council of Feature Film Evaluation and Classification, according to media in Hanoi.The image that caused offense shows Robbie standing in front of a cartoon map containing roughly sketched islands and continents with dashes in several parts of the oceans, including eight dashes off the shore of a large landmass labeled “Asia.”“The promotion and use of publications and products with the ‘nine-dash line’ is a violation and is not accepted in Vietnam,” Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said Thursday, reiterating Hanoi’s complaint.Warner Bros. denied the fleeting image had any political intention.“The map in Barbie Land is a whimsical, child-like crayon drawing,” Warner Bros. said in a statement quoted by entertainment industry news outlet Variety on Friday. “The doodles depict Barbie’s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the real world. It was not intended to make any type of statement.”The nine-dash line is a boundary used by Beijing on its maps to demarcate territorial claims over most of the South China Sea, including sections of the waterway that fall within areas claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries. Vietnam calls China’s map a “cow’s tongue” that reaches way down into Southeast Asia.The line – often literally consisting of nine dashes on a map encompassing the entire South China Sea – includes the disputed Paracel and Spratly Islands.“Barbie” is far from the first Hollywood or independent feature to run afoul of  Hanoi’s Communist government.In 2019, Vietnam halted showings of the DreamWorks film “Abominable” over a scene that showed the “nine-dash line” and drew an outcry among viewers. Netflix offerings including “Pine Gap,” “Madam Secretary,”  and “Put Your Head on My Shoulder” also ran afoul of Hanoi over the sea map.China itself has a history of pressuring foreign entertainment outfits, retailers, fashion firms, hotels and airlines over perceived misrepresentation of its borders, including that with self-governing Taiwan, over which Beijing claims sovereignty.While Vietnam’s moviegoers will have to miss “Barbie,” fans of K-Pop in the nation of 98 million will still apparently get to see the best-selling girl group BlackPink later this month.Earlier this week it appeared that the South Korean quartet’s “Born Pink World Tour Hanoi” could suffer a boycott if not a ban after reports the “nine-dash line” was posted on the website of its Vietnamese promoter. Vietnam cultural authorities said they would investigate the incident.But the China-based tour promoter, iMe Entertainment, issued an explanation and an apology, according to Vietnamese state media, and the allegedly offending image was removed. Two Hanoi concert dates – July 29 and 30 – remain on BlackPink’s website and tickets are available.Radio Free Asia’s mission is to provide accurate and timely news and information to Asian countries whose governments prohibit access to a free press.Content used with the permission of Radio Free Asia, 2025 M St. NW, Suite 300, Washington DC 20036.Your email address will not be published.

Joe Biden Addresses Age Concerns on CNN, Says He Has Wisdom;;https://www.thewrap.com/joe-biden-age-comment-cnn-interview-clip/;;;;;;The president tells CNN he foresees ”significant positive change in the world“ and ”we can do that in the next six years“President Joe Biden (Credit: CNN)President Joe Biden addressed concerns over his age while interviewing with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, saying that he has the wisdom to lead the U.S. through its current “inflection point” and he wants to “finish the job.”Capping a wide-ranging, 20-minute conversation covering foreign policy ahead the 2023 NATO Summit, Zakaria put aside previous topics like the Ukraine War and U.S. relations with China to ask the president to address Democratic constituents’ concerns that, at 80 years old, he may not be up to serving a second four-year term in the Oval Office.“You’ve often said when people asked you about your age, ‘Just watch me.’ And I think a lot of people do watch you and are impressed, and they think you’ve been a great president,” Zakaria began. “You’ve brought the economy back, you’ve restored relations with the world. But many of these people do say, and these are ardent supporters of yours, ‘The next thing he should do is step aside and let another generation of Democrats take the baton.’ Why are they wrong?”Biden responded, saying that it wasn’t a matter of right and wrong, but that he believed his age gave him the wisdom necessary to bring unity to the U.S. and democracies the world over.“I think we’re at an inflection point. I think the world is changing, and I think there is one thing that comes with age if you’re being honest about it your whole life, and that is some wisdom,” Biden said. “I think we’re on the cusp of being able to make significant positive changes in the world. I really honest to God do.”He then cited some of the efforts his administration has made overseas. “You see what we’ve done in Europe. Europe’s more united than it’s ever been since the end of World War 2,” Biden said. “You see what we’ve been able to do in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea — we’ve united that part of the world… I think we’re putting the world together in a way that is going to make things significantly — how can I say it? — more secure for people. “We’re uniting democracies — have the possibility of uniting democracies — in a way that hadn’t happened ever,” he continued. “And so I think that whether it’s the Far East, whether it’s NATO, whether it’s Europe, whether it’s what’s going on in Africa, I think we have enormous opportunities. And I think I just want to finish the job, and I think we can do that in the next six years.”Watch Biden’s CNN interview, which aired Sunday at 10 a.m. PT, in the video above.
