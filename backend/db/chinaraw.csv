ASEAN-Plus-Three to Hold Talks on South China Sea and Economic Ties - News18;;https://www.news18.com/world/asean-plus-three-to-hold-talks-on-south-china-sea-and-economic-ties-8320441.html;;;;;;Published By:  RohitAFPLast Updated: July 13, 2023, 05:46 ISTJakarta, IndonesiaA pedestrian passes by a sign of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Jakarta, Indonesia, Monday, July 10, 2023.(AP Photo)Economic cooperation and the disputed South China Sea will be on the agenda when Southeast Asian foreign ministers meet their Chinese, Japanese and South Korean counterparts for ASEAN-plus-three talks on Thursday. China will be represented at the talks by top diplomat Wang Yi instead of Foreign Minister Qin Gang after Qin pulled out for “health reasons", according to the Chinese foreign ministry.Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and his South Korean counterpart Park Jin will also attend. The grouping was established after the 1997 Asian financial crisis to develop better economic ties between Southeast Asian nations and East Asian powers.Association of Southeast Asian Nations members include this year’s chair Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, the Philippines and Myanmar.Experts said the South China Sea will be a priority because China claims almost the entirety of the strategic waterway and several ASEAN members complain about Beijing infringing on their own overlapping territorial claims there.“South China Sea is probably going to be one of the issues discussed during the ASEAN-plus-three meeting in light of recent tensions in the area," said Aleksius Jemadu, professor at Pelita Harapan University in the capital Jakarta.The waterway is an important shipping route and is crucial for both Tokyo’s and Seoul’s global supply chains.Western and Asian powers have been rattled by Beijing’s increasing assertiveness in the region, where it is applying pressure on self-ruled Taiwan and its patrol vessels have clashed with other nations’ ships.The crisis in coup-racked Myanmar will also be on the list of topics to be addressed because it is a thorny issue that divides ASEAN members, said Teuku Rezasyah, international relations expert at Padjadjaran University.“Japan and South Korea have an interest to prevent Myanmar from joining China’s orbit," he said.Recent meetings of the group have discussed ways to better cooperate on health and economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic to make the Asia-Pacific region one of the dominant drivers of global economic growth.ASEAN ministerial meetings will also be held around Thursday’s ASEAN-plus-three talks with countries that will be taking part in Friday’s 18-nation East Asia Summit.That includes India, New Zealand, Australia, Russia, China, Japan, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Jakarta on Thursday morning and will meet ASEAN members the next day.Follow us onDownload News18 App
Navy: 40% of attack submarines out of commission;;https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/military/navy-40-attack-submarines-out-commission/;;;;;;NewsNation			Kellie Meyer			(NewsNation) — In an era of heightened tensions with foreign adversaries like Russia and China, 60% of U.S. attack submarines aren’t operational. Geopolitical tension has been high, with the U.S. at odds with Russia over the war in Ukraine and China over Taiwan. Now, Congress reports many U.S. attack submarines aren’t working.It’s a perfect storm of problems. Difficulties with supply chains make it harder to get materials to shipyards, which have also had issues finding enough workers to meet day-to-day demands. It’s left the U.S. Navy with just 31 nuclear-powered attack submarines that are ready to launch in the event of a conflict. In comparison, China has just six nuclear-powered attack subs.For subs that are out of service, it won’t necessarily be easy or quick to get them back under the water. Take, for example, the USS Connecticut. Twenty months ago, it struck an underwater mountain in the South China Sea. It won’t be back in service for at least another three years. A July 6 report from Congress shows the problem has gotten worse in recent years. The last time the U.S. had so few operational submarines was 15 years ago. Proposed solutions include adding more shipyards to improve maintenance. Currently, there are just four public Navy shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia; Portsmouth, Maine; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and the Puget Sound shipyard in Bremerton, Washington.Navy and Pentagon leadership have repeatedly said the Navy’s submarine force is one of America’s top advantages over adversaries like China and Russia. But the force remains sub-par to their own goals.Delays have dropped over the past few years, with around 1,000 delays in 2022. The goal now is to get to as close to zero delays as possible by 2026, by making sure that nearly 100% of materials are on site when work begins.Copyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

‘Barbie’ Will Not Be Banned in the Philippines: - The Messenger;;https://themessenger.com/entertainment/barbie-will-not-be-banned-in-the-philippines;;;;;;After multiple review sessions and "thorough deliberations," a content review board for the Philippines released a statement saying they have decided not to ban Barbie."Considering the context by which the cartoonish map of the character 'Weird Barbie' was portrayed in the film, the Review Committee is convinced that the contentious scene does not depict the 'nine-dash line,'" MTRCB said in a statement released on July 12. "Instead, the map portrayed the route of the make-believe journey of Barbie from Barbie Land to the 'real world,' as an integral part of the story."MTRCB also noted that the film will receive a PG rating. "Having conducted two review sessions, thorough deliberations, and consultations with relevant government agencies, including a legal expert on the West Philippine Sea, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) has given the film Barbie a Parental Guidance ('PG') rating, which means viewers below thirteen (13) years old must be accompanied by a parent or supervising adult," the statement continued.The central issue around the Greta Gerwig project (out July 21) is a map that appears in the film, which some claim shows China's territorial claims in the South China Sea. A so-called "nine-dash line" can allegedly be seen overtaking territory that Vietnam and the Philippines dispute belongs to China.The country made news days before when it said it was considering banning it from movie theaters, joining countries like Vietnam, who announced their move on July 3."We do not grant license for the American movie 'Barbie' to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line," Vi Kien Thanh, head of the government entity which leads licensing and censoring foreign films, told the state-run newspaper Tuoi Tre.The Vietnam government similarly banned Sony's 2022 action film Uncharted and the 2018 Netflix thriller Pine Gap because both showed a map containing the same line."Netflix's violations angered and hurt the feelings of the entire people of Vietnam," the country's Authority of Broadcasting and Electronic Information said in a statement regarding Pine Gap. "This is the third time in a row in the last 12 months that Netflix has been found to distribute movies and TV shows containing content which violate Vietnam's sovereignty."
