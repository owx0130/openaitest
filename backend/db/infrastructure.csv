This move aligns with ADNOC Gas' plan to revolutionize natural gas distribution in the Northern Emirates of the United Arab Emirates and solidify its position as the UAE's top provider of sustainable gas. The expansion aims to bring the benefits of lower-cost, sustainable, and cleaner gas to various locations in the UAE, fostering further growth for ADNOC Gas and its shareholders. More than 70% of the contract value will be reinvested in the UAE economy thanks to ADNOC's strong In-Country Value (ICV) initiative, which was created to help local industry and strengthen the UAE's local value chain. The first part of the ESTIDAMA initiative, which comprises several phases, entailed modifying current pipelines and was successfully finished in 2023. Construction of additional pipelines and a gas compression facility in Habshan are part of the second and third stages, which are now under way. These projects will provide crucial infrastructure for supplying feed gas to important clients across the Emirates. The UAE's entire gas value chain is connected by ADNOC's integrated masterplan, providing a cost-effective and sustainable natural gas supply to fulfill domestic and global demand. The strategy calls for the development of unexplored resources as well as increased gas recovery from current assets. ADNOC's ICV initiative will reinvest 70% of the contract value in the UAE economy, strengthening local industry and the value chain.
