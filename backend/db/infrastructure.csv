ADNOC Gas is expanding its network to provide sustainable and cleaner gas to various locations in the UAE. This move aligns with their commitment to achieving gas self-sufficiency for the UAE and their goal of increasing market share and drawing in a larger customer base. 70% of the contract value will be reinvested in the UAE economy thanks to ADNOC's strong In-Country Value (ICV) initiative, which was created to help local industry and strengthen the UAE's local value chain. The first part of the ESTIDAMA initiative, which entails modifying current pipelines, was successfully finished in 2023. Construction of additional pipelines and a gas compression facility in Habshan are part of the second and third stages, which are now underway. These projects will provide crucial infrastructure for supplying feed gas to important clients across the Emirates. The UAE's entire gas value chain is connected by ADNOC's integrated masterplan, providing a cost-effective and sustainable natural gas supply to fulfill domestic and global demand. The strategy calls for the development of unexplored resources as well as increased gas recovery from current assets. ADNOC's ICV initiative will reinvest 70% of contract value in the UAE economy, strengthening local industry and value chain.
Thailand's PTT Seeking 15-Year LNG Supply Deal with Qatar | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/thailands-ptt-seeking-15-year-lng-supply-deal-with-qatar;;Thailand, PTT, Qatar, Russia, Oman LNG;;Yes;;Thailand's PTT is currently in discussions with Qatar regarding a potential 15-year LNG supply agreement. This comes as Asian buyers, including PTT, are seeking long-term supply contracts to replace piped gas from Russia. Qatar, with its expanding liquefaction capacity, has already secured three LNG supply deals with Asian buyers and is expected to secure more in the future. PTT has also recently signed a nine-year agreement with Oman LNG. As Thailand is a net importer of oil and gas, it is necessary for the country to increase its LNG imports in order to compensate for a decline in gas production. The plan is for Thailand to import 800,000 tons of LNG per year starting in 2026 to offset this production decrease.
