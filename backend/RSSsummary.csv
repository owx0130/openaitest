Italy's Eni Wants to Reduce Oil Exposure with Asset Sales | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/italys-eni-wants-to-reduce-oil-exposure-with-asset-sales;;Eni, Neptune Energy, COP28, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Africa;;Yes;;Eni plans to reduce its exposure to oil and increase its focus on natural gas and non-fossil fuels through asset sales and acquisitions. They aim to generate â‚¬1 billion in net proceeds between 2023 and 2026. The recent acquisition of Neptune Energy aligns with Eni's strategy, reducing carbon intensity and expanding their carbon capture and storage business. At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, Eni will present investment projects in Africa, including renewable energy and agri-hubs for biofuel. A recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) states that the energy transition is currently off-track, calling for higher and more diversified investment from both public and private investors.
Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Likely to Send More Canadian Oil to US, Not Asia | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-likely-to-send-more-canadian-oil-to-us-not-asia;;Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion, Wood Mackenzie, North America, Southern California, Turner, Mason & Company;;Yes;;The Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) project has been affected by Western sanctions on Russia, resulting in an influx of Russian crude in Asian markets and making it difficult for Canadian barrels to compete. Wood Mackenzie predicts that a significant portion of the crude shipped through TMX will stay in North America. Regulatory delays and environmental opposition have also made TMX less lucrative for producers. The expanded pipeline will transport mostly heavy oil, with the strongest demand expected from refineries in southern California that are set up to process heavy sour crude. The deep discounts on Russian crude are temporary, and it is anticipated that more TMX barrels may head to Asia and displace some Middle Eastern barrels once Western sanctions against Moscow eventually lift. According to Skip York, chief energy strategist at Turner, Mason & Company, diluted bitumen should compete fairly well against Arab heavy and Basra heavy crude when Western sanctions against Moscow eventually lift, allowing more TMX barrels to head to Asia and displace some Middle Eastern barrels.
