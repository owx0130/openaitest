Court Holds TC Energy Liable for Fiduciary Duty Breaches in Columbia Pipeline Deal | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/june/court-holds-tc-energy-liable-for-fiduciary-duty-breaches-in-columbia-pipeline-deal;;Delaware Court of Chancery, TC Energy Corp., Columbia Pipeline Group Inc., Bernstein Litowitz, Labaton Sucharow LLP;;Yes;;The Delaware Court of Chancery has ruled that TC Energy Corp. is liable for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty by former executives of Columbia Pipeline Group Inc. Former Columbia shareholders have been awarded $1.00 per share in economic damages and $0.50 per share in disclosure damages. This is one of the largest shareholder verdicts in Delaware history and is the result of the hard work by the Bernstein Litowitz team. The decision finds that an acquiring party who repeatedly exploited breaches of duty by target officers can be held liable for aiding and abetting the selling parties' breaches of fiduciary duty. This reaffirms that potential acquirers and their advisors in the M&A market cannot knowingly participate in breaches of fiduciary duty by senior executives of target companies. Investors represented by Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP and Labaton Sucharow LLP sued TC Energy Corp. for stockholder benefit.
