The company aims to generate â‚¬1 billion in net proceeds between 2023 and 2026. To further this goal, Eni recently acquired Neptune Energy, which reduces carbon intensity and expands their carbon capture and storage business. Additionally, Eni will attend the COP28 climate summit in Dubai to present investment projects in Africa, including renewable energy and agri-hubs for biofuel. However, a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) states that the energy transition is currently off-track, calling for higher and more diversified investment by both public and private investors.
