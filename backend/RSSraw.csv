Microsoft unites with traditional owners on new data centre;;https://datacenternews.asia/story/microsoft-unites-with-traditional-owners-on-new-data-centre;;;;;;;;Microsoft collaborates with Indigital and traditional owners' artwork and landscape design for its new Western Sydney data centre. Microsoft's new data centre site at Kemps Creek in Western Sydney hosted a Land Acknowledgement, one of many activities connecting local Indigenous culture with the data centre build, in an Australian first among hyperscale cloud providers. Building for the future while respecting the significance of historical Indigital is an Indigenous-owned profit-for-purpose organisation connecting critical infrastructure with First Nations Country and Culture. They have worked closely with the Dharug people, the Traditional Custodians of the land hosting the data centre, to shape the site's exterior artwork and landscape design to support cultural connection and inclusion. Mikaela Jade, Cabrogal woman, Founder and CEO of Indigital, led the project bringing together members of the Dharug Nation to be involved in the 'Connecting with Country' process. This process was aligned with the Government Architect NSW's Connecting with Country draft framework, created to help develop connections with Country to inform the planning, design and delivery of built environment projects in the state. Over eight months, Indigital facilitated weekly constructive and collaborative meetings, incorporating traditional Indigenous practices and their role in future development. The project marked the first time the Cabrogal Clan and the broader Dharug Nation met on the Country in more than 100 years.Jade says: "The methods we used to connect our culture to Microsoft's planned data centre site were as old as time." "We came together on Country, spoke to ancestral beings, imagined what Country was like before colonisation, and imagined colour schemes, stories and relationships." "We brought that forward to the present and explored how traditional owners and custodians interpret Country now, and imagined what this site will be like in 40 years' time," says Jade.Indigital trained a machine learning algorithm using traditional imagery to understand interpretations of the Dharug Nation's resilience. The algorithm created culturally recognised patterns and imagery that will be reflected in the site's exterior artwork and landscape design.Julie Bukari Webb, Dharug woman, Traditional Custodian and Knowledge Holder, says that the project ensured Indigenous ways, traditions, and perspectives don't get lost in new builds of critical infrastructure. "I'm really proud of how we've come together in love and unity to create a lot of joy and understanding. The artwork we created captures all of that in a bundle that will be represented at the Microsoft Kemps Creek Data Centre," says Webb.Microsoft's new data centre represents a significant capital investment and long-term commitment to the local community, with the Kemps Creek site expected to fuel job growth in Western Sydney.The company estimates it will require 4,575 construction roles and 18.6 million work hours to build new data centres in Australia, and it intends to fill 25% to 30% of positions with local contractors. Once fully operational, Microsoft anticipates 300 full-time employees will work at its new data centres in NSW and Victoria.As part of the data centre build and its support for the Dharug Nation, Microsoft has extended its partnership with Indigital in Western Sydney this year via the Indigital Schools program. This connects Elders with primary and secondary school students to share cultural knowledge, history and traditions. The program runs in 20 schools across Western Sydney and reaches over 500 students, encouraging students to leverage the latest technology and upskill for the digital economy. By using creative apps like Paint 3D, Minecraft and Maya, students are thinking conceptually about cultural questions and creating visual representations of the characters and environments from the stories of Elders. To mobilise First Nations communities, Microsoft and the Kemps Creek site development partners have learned what it means to build a data centre on Country while respecting one of the world's oldest continuing cultures. During the project, recognising Indigenous land rights, ensuring cultural sensitivity and respect, and providing economic opportunity for Indigenous people have been key considerations for Microsoft. Steven Worrall, Managing Director at Microsoft Australia and New Zealand, says: "We have a strong commitment to deep learning in Indigenous ways of being, knowing and doing.""In the spirit of collaborating and listening, Microsoft is proud to work with Indigital and Dharug Nation Traditional Custodians to reflect Indigenous connection to Country at our Kemps Creek Data Centre.""We're excited by the demand we're seeing from customers for Azure in Australia, including unprecedented interest in our cutting-edge AI workloads." "We are continuing to invest to meet the capacity requirements, but in a way that meets our ambitious sustainability goals and investments in the communities in which we operate," says Worrall. 
Germany, South Africa Agree to Cooperate on Green Hydrogen Projects | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/june/germany-south-africa-agree-to-cooperate-on-green-hydrogen-projects;;;;;;;;(Reuters) — Germany and South Africa on Tuesday agreed to cooperate on green hydrogen projects in the latest bid by Europe to tap into Africa's huge renewable resource potential to meet 2050 net-zero targets.Under the deal, Germany will assist in developing markets, facilitating imports and linking producers with technology partners, said Masopha Moshoeshoe, an executive in the investment and infrastructure office of South Africa's presidency.The partnership will "assist in creating business to business opportunities between our developers as well as off-takers in Germany," Moshoeshoe said.Green hydrogen, produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy, can be used as fuel use across industries such as transport, petrochemicals and steel.European countries are turning to Africa to secure future supplies of the fuel, investing heavily in green hydrogen projects in countries from Namibia to Morocco and Egypt to South Africa.Last week, the Netherlands and Denmark launched a $1 billion green hydrogen fund in South Africa. A similar fund was launched in Namibia last year.South Africa, the continent's most advanced economy and the world's 14th biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has also made green hydrogen an important pillar of its own decarbonization efforts.President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the country would need up to 319 billion rand ($17.28 billion) of investment to kick-start the industry.So far it has received $700 billion dollars under $8.5 billion pledged to it by a group of rich countries including France, Germany, Britain, the United States and the European Union. Tuesday's agreement did not specify any investment target by either country.($1 = 18.4562 rand)
Greek Gas Grid Says 27 Companies Interested in Booking Future Capacity | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/june/greek-gas-grid-says-27-companies-interested-in-booking-future-capacity;;;;;;;;(Reuters) — Greece has received interest from 27 U.S. and European companies in booking future capacity at its gas grid, which would allow them to import and export gas to Europe via the country in the coming decades, grid operator DESFA said on Thursday.Greece has become a key transit route for gas in Europe thanks to a liquefied gas facility off Athens, which saw increased traffic from around the world after the war in Ukraine cut flows of Russian gas to the continent.It also has gas interconnections with Bulgaria and Turkey, while several floating storage and gas regasification units are either being built or in the pipeline.DESFA launched in March a market test to sound out interest from companies in booking future capacity at the grid's entry and exit points, citing a rising number of requests.Companies from Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Germany, Cyprus, North Macedonia and the U.S. have requested capacity allocation to import and export gas from next year up to 2050, both through existing and new entry points, DESFA said in a statement.The current expressions of interest have been non-binding. The binding phase is expected to start in 2024 and will conclude with capacity allocation to bidders which meet specific criteria, DESFA said.
