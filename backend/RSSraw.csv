Italy's Eni Wants to Reduce Oil Exposure with Asset Sales | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/italys-eni-wants-to-reduce-oil-exposure-with-asset-sales;;;;;;(Reuters) — Italy's Eni aims to reduce its exposure to oil in favor of natural gas and non-fossil fuels in part through asset sales, the energy group's CEO Claudio Descalzi said on Tuesday.Speaking at the Rome presentation of a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Descalzi added he could not comment on potential oil asset sales in the near term.Eni plans to generate 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of net proceeds from the balance between asset sales and acquisitions between 2023 and 2026, the company said in its business plan.Last month, Eni announced the sale of some of its oil assets in Congo, just a few days after saying it had agreed to buy Neptune Energy.Descalzi said the acquisition would reduce Eni's average carbon intensity, since Neptune is focused on natural gas. The deal also provides an opportunity to expand the carbon capture and storage business of Eni's Vaar business in northern Europe."This is why the acquisition of Neptune is not in contrast with the energy transition path," Descalzi said.Eni will attend the COP28 climate summit later this year in Dubai, participating directly in the event for the first time, the CEO said.The group will present its investment projects in Africa, including the development of renewable energy and the creation of agri-hubs to produce feedstock for its biofuel business, he said.In a recent assessment of efforts to meet the key Paris accord target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, IRENA said the energy transition was currently "off-track".In the report presented on Tuesday, the agency called for higher and more diversified investment by both public and private investors.($1 = 0.9178 euros)
Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Likely to Send More Canadian Oil to US, Not Asia | Pipeline and Gas Journal;;https://pgjonline.com/news/2023/july/trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-likely-to-send-more-canadian-oil-to-us-not-asia;;;;;;(Reuters) — The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (TMX) was meant to unlock Asian markets for Canadian oil, but analysts and traders said those barrels now will probably land on the U.S. West Coast as Asia gobbles up Russian oil that is cheaper due to sanctions from Western countries after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Asia's heavy crude refining market is roughly nine times the size of California's, but the geopolitical upheaval means Canada will struggle to reduce its reliance on its No. 1 oil customer, the United States.The troubled C$30.9 billion ($23.5 billion) TMX project, bought by the Canadian government in 2018 to ensure it got built, is finally nearing completion more than a decade after it was first proposed as an expanded gateway to Asia.Western sanctions on Russian crude following its invasion of Ukraine have upended those plans. Russia has been flooding Asian markets with cheap Urals and ESPO crudes. Canadian barrels will struggle to compete, analysts and traders said.TMX next year is due to start shipping an extra 590,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude early from Alberta to British Columbia's Pacific Coast, where it will be loaded onto tankers for export."We think a disproportionate amount of those volumes are going actually to PADD 5 (the U.S. West Coast), staying within North America instead of Asia," said John Coleman, principal analyst of North American crude markets at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Russian crude imports by China and India hit an all-time high in May.Chinese oil refiners PetroChina and Sinopec have bought and processed Canadian heavy crude in the past.Their purchases are based on relative affordability, trade sources said. Russia's Urals crude produces higher volumes of fuel and is significantly cheaper than heavy Canadian barrels, said one Calgary-based crude trader.Another Canadian trader said regulatory delays and environmental opposition have also made TMX less lucrative for producers than it could have been a few years ago."A lot of our lunch has been eaten by the Russians and Middle Eastern countries like Iraq," he said.Heavy Crude DemandTrans Mountain's original pipeline currently ships around 300,000 bpd of mainly light crude to the U.S. West Coast, with BP's Cherry Point refinery and HF Sinclair Corp.'s Puget Sound refinery among the main customers for Canadian imports, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.The expanded pipeline will transport mostly heavy oil, said Skip York, chief energy strategist at Turner, Mason & Company, and the strongest demand will likely come from refineries in southern California that are set up to process heavy sour crude.The deep discounts on Russian crude are temporary, said York, and more TMX barrels may head to Asia and displace some Middle Eastern barrels once Western sanctions against Moscow eventually lift."Today every crude in Asia is having a hard time competing with Russian crude," York said. "But diluted bitumen ought to compete fairly well against Arab heavy and will compete against Basra heavy."($1 = 1.3146 Canadian dollars)
