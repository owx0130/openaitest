Number 8860726.Eileen Ann | Jul 06, 2023An increasing number of organizations today are opting to outsource at least some aspects of data center operations. Why? Because data center outsourcing (DCO) helps organizations reduce costs and free up resources to dedicate to other business priorities by shifting data center infrastructure and responsibilities to a service provider.According to market research firm Data Bridge, the data center outsourcing market will reach an estimated value of about $320 billion by 2028. Increasing demand for IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) is one factor driving DCO market growth.Related: Colocation Data Center vs. Private Data Center: Which Is Right for You?Whether you’re new to DCO and curious to learn more or familiar with DCO and ready to get started today, this article covers everything you need to know. We explore the different DCO types and models, weigh the benefits and challenges, share how to evaluate a DCO service provider, and outline 10 steps to get started with DCO.DCO, or data center outsourcing, is the practice of delegating all or some of the day-to-day management and operation of data centers to a third-party service provider. The outsourcing partnership can be annual or multi-year, occur on- or off-premises, and include services like computing, security, infrastructure maintenance, disaster recover, network essentials, and many other professional services, depending on the specific needs of an organization.Related: Why 'Data Center vs. Cloud' Is the Wrong Way to ThinkThere are three main types of data center outsourcing by geographic location: Onshoring, Nearshoring, and Offshoring.Onshoring, sometimes known as domestic outsourcing, refers to contracting a data center service provider located within the same country as the organization. Onshoring is an attractive option for organizations that prioritize factors such as geographic proximity, working in the same time zone, local regulations, and cultural and language compatibility. Drawbacks to this option include limitations in skillsets and higher costs.Nearshoring refers to contracting a data center service provider located in a nearby country or region from the organization. While not in the organization’s home country, the service provider is close enough geographically to help the organization balance cost savings with benefits such as similar time zones, ease of travel, and cultural and language similarities.Offshoring refers to contracting a data center service provider located in a distant country or on a different continent than the organization. This option may provide significant cost savings through lower labor costs but can introduce challenges like considerable time zone differences, cultural or language barriers, and difficulty in overseeing or verifying compliance and security practices.Four of the main DCO models are colocation, managed services, cloud services and the hybrid model. Which is right for you? We detail each of them below and list some of the pros and cons of each model.The colocation DCO model occurs when an organization physically deploys IT equipment in data centers owned and managed by a third-party provider. The organization retains control over its servers, storage, and networking equipment, while the service provider offers the physical infrastructure, power, cooling, and connectivity.Organizations may choose colocation because of several benefits, like a lower cost of entry, scalability, less maintenance, and location flexibility. Drawbacks to this option include a loss of complete control, less flexibility for physical access, and migration challenges.The managed services DCO model, sometimes known as Data Center as a Service (DCaaS), occurs when an organization leases data center infrastructure from a service provider. This provider will also assume responsibility for day-to-day operations. These services may include hardware procurement, installation, monitoring, maintenance, and support, ensuring the availability, performance, and security of the data center.The managed services model is an attractive option for organizations who want to leverage the service provider’s expertise to free up resources so they can focus on their core business activities.The cloud services DCO model involves outsourcing resources and infrastructure to a cloud services provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. This option does not require maintaining any physical servers, as organizations can access computing resources, storage, and applications on the web.Organizations may find the cloud services option beneficial because of its scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency – organizations only pay for the resources they use.The hybrid DCO model combines multiple models to meet an organization’s specific needs. This could include in-house, on-premises infrastructure management for core workloads and a colocation service provider for non-core activities.The hybrid model is best suited for organizations searching for flexibility to meet their data center needs.There are several factors to consider when deciding whether to outsource any of your data center management needs.After you’ve decided to move forward with data center outsourcing, then what? We break down 10 steps to successful data center outsourcing.Cloud computing can be considered a type of DCO. Instead of using physical data center infrastructure for their computing needs, organizations can access computing resources on the web through cloud service providers.Pricing can come in the form of fixed, usage-based, or tiered pricing and depend on factors like contract length, services needed, support provided, and ancillary costs like setup, migration, data transfer, hardware, or software licensing fees.Compliance and security requirements include data privacy, security controls, industry-specific regulations like HIPAA or PCI, compliance certifications like SOC 2 (Service Organization Controls) or FedRAMP (for US government agencies), audits, and business continuity and disaster recovery.Data center infrastructure needs may include storage infrastructure, computing resources, power and cooling, physical security, and network infrastructure.More information about text formatsFollow us:
